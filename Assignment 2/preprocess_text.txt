natural language processing nlp is a subfield of computer science and especially artificial intelligence it is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in 
 natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval knowledge representation and computational linguistics a subfield of linguistics typically data is collected in text corpora using
  either rulebased statistical or neuralbased approaches in machine learning and deep learning 
 major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition text classification naturallanguage understanding and naturallanguage generation 
 natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s1 already in 1950 alan turing published an article titled computing machinery and intelligence which proposed what is now called the turing test a
 s a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence the proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretatio

 care16 or protect patient privacy17 
 symbolic approach ie the handcoding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by ai in general and by nlp in particular1
 819 such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming 
 machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach 
 although rulebased systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020 they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of llms in 2023 
 before that they were commonly used 
 in the late 1980s and mid1990s the statistical approach ended a period of ai winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rulebased approaches2021 
 the earliest decision trees producing systems of hard ifthen rules were still very similar to the old rulebased approaches only the introduction of hidden markov models applied to partofspeech tagging
  announced the end of the old rulebased approach 
 a major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering since 201522 the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach using semantic networ
 ks23 and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words 
 intermediate tasks eg partofspeech tagging and dependency parsing are not needed anymore 
 neural machine translation based on thennewly invented sequencetosequence transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine trans

 the following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing some of these tasks have direct realworld applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks
  that are used to aid in solving larger tasks 
 though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined they can be subdivided into categories for convenience a coarse division is given below 
 based on longstanding trends in the field it is possible to extrapolate future directions of nlp as of 2020 three trends among the topics of the longstanding series of conll shared tasks can be observ
